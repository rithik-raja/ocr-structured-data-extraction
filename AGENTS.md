This is a Next.js + ShadCN dashboard.
We are building OCR+AI document intelligence:
• OCR vision + GPT analysis
• Structured JSON output

This is a demo dashboard for internal use, so there will be no backend integration.
All shadcn components are already installed and available in components/ui. Use shadcn whenever possible and prefer using it over creating your own component.
Assume all dependencies are already installed
Upon completing a code change, run npx tsc --noEmit. If, then, you find a missing package, alert me and I will install it. Note that your current sandbox does not have internet access.
